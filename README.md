# CS-320
This repository contains A collection of the coding assignments I completed  in my CS 320 - Data Science Modeling 2 course at UW Madison in the spring of 2023.


Each project folder contains A README markdown file that contains the instructions I was given for each coding project. Project structures varried; some were a list of questions/problems that I answered using python code, and some asked me to write larger programs to complete specific tasks.

The concepts I learned in this course include:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Recursion
- Graphs and Trees
  - Breadth first/Depth First Search
- Website building
  - Selenium
  - Recursive Crawl
  - Flask
  - A/B Testing
- Regex
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
